# Introduction
THE PROJECT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT. I'M WORKING HARD TO MAKE A VERSION THATE WILL WORK FOR EVERYONE.

This project aims to create an open-source, modular, and easy-to-understand design for a fight-stick (Hit Box) layout using the Arduino Pro Micro as the core.
My goal is to make the project as accessible and customizable as possible, providing everyone with the flexibility to adapt the design to their specific needs.

# Lets Talk About Cost

1. Just the PCB (order minimum is 5 PCBs) without shipping is **$8**, and shipping will differ depending on where you ship to and the shipping method.
2. The parts you will need to assemble the PCB will cost about **$25** (hot swap sockets, keys, switches, Pro Micro, and IC Sockets).
3. If you have no tools and need to get some, that will cost you as much as you want to spend on it. You can easily spend a fortune on tools, but you don't have to; use the list below to help you form a better decision.

OVERALL, THE COST FOR THIS PROJECT COULD CHANGE DEPENDING ON THE TOOLS YOU HAVE AND ACCESS TO MATERIALS YOU HAVE AS WELL.

## Part List 

The most important thing for me with this project was to provide a learning experience to anyone interested in PCB design, 3D printing, soldering, and more, all while keeping the cost to the bare minimum. Unfortunately, you still have to pay for the parts needed and the PCB, but to ensure you don't spend on unnecessary items while still learning, I handled all the spending for you. I've assembled a list of everything you'll need to complete this project, and I'll strive to keep this list updated. Shipping could change the cost dramatically, so I did not include links. [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com) is probably the best place to get all the electronic components. Amazon is not so great due to high prices and low-quality items, but you can find decent items there. Other than that, here is a list of all the things you should get, with alternatives as well.

- PCB | $8 (without shipping)
- (optional) Hot-swappable PCB socket | $3
- Keycaps | $5-$15 (depends on quality)
- Switch | $5-$50 (huge difference between manufacturers and "quality" of the switch)
- Pro Micro | $4-$30 (Depends on the manufacturer and variant, make sure the chip is **atmega32u4**)

### Recommended

- KESTER SOLDER | $35-$60 (by far the most pricey, you can manage with any other soldering wire, but this one is by far the best solder I have)
- PINECIL â€“ Smart Mini Portable Soldering Iron (Version 2) | $25.99-$35.99

# Features
- **Comprehensive Design Files**: The project includes not only the PCB design but also the STL and Fusion 360 files for the plate and case.
- **Connectivity**: The PCB offers both direct and hot-swap connectivity. This allows users the choice between soldering hot-swap sockets or directly soldering switches onto the PCB, providing a great deal of flexibility in how the board is assembled.
- **Compatibility**: The PCB can be compatible with Pro Micro, more microcontrollers will be added in the future

# Note
This project is an open-source initiative. It has been made as modular as possible, making it easy to understand and modify in the future. I believe in the power of community and collaboration, and welcome contributions and suggestions from all those interested in this project.
